This is a simple program to find the solution to a random math problem I found on Reddit

There was a reddit post that was asking how a 5th grader was supposed to solve this problem:

Digits 1-9 are used to solve abc * de = fghi and no digit can be used more than once

I agree, it is a pretty complex math problem for a 5th grader. I could've solved it on my own, but felt like it would be easier to let the computer do it for me, so I made this program to solve it!
